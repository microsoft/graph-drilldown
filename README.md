# graph-drill

This is a rapid prototype of a hierarchical graph viewer. Each node is expected to be assigned a community
using a hierarchical technique such as Louvain or Leiden. The communities will then be color-coded, and zooming
will drill down into the visible/selected communities.

# Getting started

This is a typical node/React project. Here is what you'll need to get running:

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for your platform
2. Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

After those dependencies are installed, from a command line:

1. `yarn install` - will get app dependencies downloaded and installed (see dependencies section below)
2. `yarn start` - will run the dev server and launch the app in your browser, usually at http://localhost:3000

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app locally. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn bundle`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

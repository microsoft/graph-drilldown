## joinWithReplace() function

Simple join that replaces any columns in the left with matching columns in the right. Normal arquero behavior is the rename collisions, but we have so much dependence on expected columns that this causes problems. It's especially frequent because the join keys are renamed, so this lets us join and exclude the key

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function joinWithReplace(left: ColumnTable, right: ColumnTable, joinDefinition: any): ColumnTable;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  left | ColumnTable | left side of join |
|  right | ColumnTable | right side of join |
|  joinDefinition | any |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

ColumnTable

## findNodesTableForCommunity() function

Gets a table of just the nodes for a matching community. The preferred outcome here is to use the grouped-by-parent table, because this retains child community differentiability. However, if the selected community is a leaf in the hierarchy, it will have no child communities and therefore filtering by 'parent' will not return it (because there are no rows with this cid as parent). In this case, we use the grouped-by-community variant to get the nodes.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function findNodesTableForCommunity(cid: string | undefined, byParent: ColumnTable, byCommunity: ColumnTable): ColumnTable;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  cid | string \| undefined | community id |
|  byParent | ColumnTable | table grouped by parent |
|  byCommunity | ColumnTable | table grouped by community |

<b>Returns:</b>

ColumnTable
